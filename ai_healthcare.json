Machine Learning (ML):</strong> Algorithms that learn from data. This includes:</p><ul><li><em>Supervised Learning:</em> Used for tasks like image classification (e.g., identifying tumors) or predicting patient risk based on historical data.</li><li><em>Unsupervised Learning:</em> Used for discovering patterns in patient data, such as identifying patient cohorts with similar characteristics.</li></ul><p><strong>2. Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> Enables computers to understand and process human language. In healthcare, NLP is used for:</p><ul><li>Extracting information from clinical notes and medical literature.</li><li>Powering medical chatbots for patient interaction.</li><li>Transcribing doctor-patient conversations.</li></ul><p><strong>3. Deep Learning:</strong> A subset of ML using neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks). It has shown remarkable success in medical image analysis and complex pattern recognition in genomic data.</p>",

Ensuring its secure storage, transmission, and use in AI systems is paramount (e.g., complying with HIPAA in the US).</li><li><strong>Algorithmic Bias:</strong> AI models are trained on data. If this data reflects existing biases (e.g., racial, gender, socioeconomic), the models can perpetuate or even amplify these biases, leading to health disparities.</li><li><strong>Transparency and Explainability (Black Box Problem):</strong> Some complex AI models, like deep neural networks, can be 'black boxes,' making it difficult to understand how they arrive at a decision. This is problematic in healthcare where accountability and trust are critical.</li><li><strong>Regulatory Hurdles:</strong> Developing and approving AI-driven medical devices and software requires navigating complex regulatory pathways.</li><li><strong>Integration with Existing Systems:</strong> Incorporating new AI tools into established clinical workflows can be challenging.</li><li><strong>Job Displacement Fears:</strong> Concerns about AI replacing healthcare professionals, though the current focus is more on augmentation.</li></ul>",
